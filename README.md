# Ben's Python Project!

Hello, this is my Spacestation game.


# Installation

The best way of trying my game is, by building a new virtual environment with my "requirements.txt". There are all librarys you need to play my game.

## Play the Game

To play my game, just open a new Terminal tab from the "projektarbeit_python" folder and type in `python3 source/main.py`
